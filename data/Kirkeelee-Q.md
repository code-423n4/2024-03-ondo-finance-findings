 The ERC20 transfer() and transferFrom() functions return a boolean value. The return value needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead. retrieveTokens function in ousgInstantManager.sol uses transfer() and it may lead to issues with non-compliant ERC20 tokens which do not return a boolean value. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom().
